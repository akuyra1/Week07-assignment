# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



WHAT THE APP IS:

- USER CAN SELECT A SOLAR SYSTEM PLANET AND LEAVE A COMMENT.
    - THE COMMENT SHOULD BE A FACT A USER KNOWS ABOUT THE SELECTED SOLAR SYSTEM PLANET
    - USER SHOULD BE ABLE TO OPEN THE CATEGORY AND SEE ALL POSTS LEFT ABOUT THAT SELECTED PLANET.
